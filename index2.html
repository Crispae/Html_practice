    <!---In case of css which is entirely a different language
    then html.
1. we use a particular element to apply design to that thing
2. Here we have only single div so it selects that div and apply
the properties which we have defiend in the the style element in the 
html
3. We have also apply propertie to the p element using the sam eprocess
4. while providibg the font size using css we ahve different ways like
        using px
        using in
        using pt
The most preferred way is using the pt option

5. There are 3 differrent way which we can apply css to an html page
        1. use the style tsg within the same html page
        2. using  a diffrent file of the css in which we define the property 
            for the  particular eleemnt of that html page by using the link tag in html in whcih we
            href the css file snd using rel(relationship) using the stylesheet-->
